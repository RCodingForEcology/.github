## 📚 About the Book

**R Coding for Ecology** is devoted to ecological data analysis using **R**, covering:

- Species distribution modelling  
- Population and community ecology  
- Spatial ecology  
- Ecological remote sensing  
- Spatio-ecological data visualization  

The book emphasizes **fully reproducible examples**, allowing readers to move from theory to practice by running and modifying real code.
